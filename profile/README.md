## Welcome, to our GitHub organizational profile!
Here, you can find a vast collection of the codes that we have been working on.
These code bases are all linked to open-source available research, most of which can be found through the [TU Delft Repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/).
If you are new/curious to read more about airborne wind energy in general, we recommend checking out [Airborne Wind Europe](https://airbornewindeurope.org/), and for the perfect walk through the fundamentals, we highly recommend [R. Schmehls lecture slides](https://awecourse.github.io/slides/).
