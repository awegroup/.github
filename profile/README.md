## Welcome, to our GitHub organizational profile!
Here, you can find a vast collection of the codes we have worked on.
These code bases are all linked to open-source available research, most of which can be found through the [TU Delft Repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/).

If you are curious to read more about airborne wind energy in general, we recommend:
- [The lecture notes](https://awecourse.github.io/slides/) from Roland Schmehl's MSc course at the AE Faculty of the TU Delft.
- [Airborne Wind Europe](https://airbornewindeurope.org/) for more general information
- [The white paper](https://airbornewindeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BVGA-Getting-Airborne-White-Paper-220929.pdf) written with many prominent people in the industry and BVGAssociates.
